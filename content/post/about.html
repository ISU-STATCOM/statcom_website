<h3>About our Volunteers</h3>
<p>Our volunteers are students who are interested in serving the community through statistical
consulting projects. Our volunteers are mainly comprised of graduate students in the
Department of Statistics (MS and Ph.D.). Faculty members serve an advisory role in STATCOM,
providing leadership, assistance with client meetings, and statistical consulting advice as needed, especially in initial consultations. However, projects are conducted and led by our student volunteers.</p>
